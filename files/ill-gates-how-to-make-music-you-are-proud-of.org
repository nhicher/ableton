* from quantity comes quality
* learn to finish yours tracks, then focus on speed
* 80% of gain are from learning to listen
* make a ref playlist (10 or 20 tracks)
** all genres
** genre specific (as style ref)
* use your eyes to train -> pure analyser system
* arrangement exercise
** start with a simple reference
** line it up with bars in DAW (intro ...)
** make empty clips for sounds
** label them clearly
** get a visual of the arrangement and composition
* next level - remake song
** study != plagiarism
* prepare your sounds library
* snowflake (unique sounds )vs robots (folders)
** snowflake folder
*** spark -> inspiring starts
*** faces -> title concepts + lyrics
*** purple cows -> WTF sounds
*** ideas + stingers -> audio branding
** robots folder
*** 3 drum racks method
*** meat
**** kick, snare, clap
*** patatoes
**** rimshot, hi hat, crash
*** spice
**** laser, trap, high clap ?
*** subbass + other basic patches
*** sound effects + risers
*** user folders in all plugins
*** channel stips + audio effects
* stop digging to folders
** once a year make a user folder
** make favorites in every categories
** have best of folder in favorites
** make 128s (sample selection) for all your samples archives
** never waste writing time again

* how to make 128s
** drag sample folder into sampler
** duplicate if more than 128
** select all samples in sampler
** right clic, distribute range equally
** save to lib, name memorably
* zone types for 128s
** all samples have zones
** how to you plan to distribute them -> key = one sample per note
* collect all samples on export?
** in library preference
** move samples to lib
*** yes -> good for your favorites
*** no -> good for external drive
** don't make your internal drive or lib > 50GB
* Workflow
** Make a music recipe
*** production = problem solving
*** what are your problems?
*** what order do you solve them in?
*** learn to finish everytime
*** focus on speed, then quality
*** recipe evolve with practice
*** next level
**** time beat
***** choose sample 5 min
***** make arrange 5 min
** phase 1 - The super loop
*** adding ideas to the loop
*** always start with a spark
*** say yes to everything, don't criticize
*** you want to many good ideas
*** find the face or go to your face folder
*** mute and unmute channels to test
** phase 2 - Arrangement
*** duplicate super loop to all song (3min)
*** label sections at the top
*** write by subtracking
*** delete part of the loop to make sections
*** add variations + simple automations
** phase 3 - Make stems + edit
*** end of phase 2, you think you've done
*** you're not done, go to phase 2
*** turn everything in audio stems
*** add details + edit to make it tight
** phase 4 - finish your mix down
** phase 5 - send it off to mastering
** finish and remix
* Composing the mix
** full, clear, balanced + focus on all systems
** separation of foreground, middleground, background
** clear hierarchy of importance, focus all the time
** appropirate for style of the individual song
** easy to understand what composer is going for
* compo 101 - singer and band
** Most people only heard 2 things:
*** singer which stand out
*** band as a unit
** Same thing without vocal
** every composition needs a focus
** the hierarchy of presence
*** focus must dominate all possible aspects
*** compo, mixing and sound design
*** volume, 3 extremes + pain zone
*** focus sit on top and in front of the mix
*** video the are of mixing - david gibson
** 5 extremes
*** high above 8kHz
*** low below 80Hz
*** side only signal
*** pain zone 2kHz - 5kHz
*** transient structure
* Volume 80% of the mixing
** first/closest control any hw mixer
** how lound/quiet a sound is the most important factor when mixing
** before adding plugin try to adjust volume 80% of the time it will fix your issue
* Magic quest
** does this sound needs to stand out (se dÃ©marquer) or blend in (se fondre dans la masse)
** adjust level (80% of the time)
** does an aspect needs to stand out or blend in?
** then adjust the sound aspect approx
** freq: use layering, saturation or eq
** power: layering, saturation, compress or eq
** transient: layering, clipping, limit or compress
** stereo: layering, chorus, phaser, reverb, width
** focus: make space with mute + eq on other sounds
** when in doubt, simplify all faders down, then bring up the most important
** 5 dim
*** high/low
*** essential + ditch the rest
*** side
*** 2 sensitivities -> transient and painzone
* Path to glory
** remix your live - you are your habits
** progress demands daily practices
** new habits need discipline ... at first
** practice create momentum
** momentum create inspiration
** inspired work becomes a positive addiction
** a mentor job is to start this feedback loop
